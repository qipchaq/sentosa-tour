              either: (a) from that data or (b) from that data combined with

              personal data we may collect from you, based on your interactions

            <p>
              Your consent for the collection, use, and disclosure of your
              personal data remains valid until you withdraw it in writing. To
              withdraw consent and request that we stop using and/or disclosing
              your personal data for any or all of the purposes listed above,
              submit your request in writing or via email to our Data Protection
              Officer at the contact details provided below. Upon receiving your
              written request to withdraw consent, we may need a reasonable
              amount of time (depending on the request&apos;s complexity and its
              impact on our relationship with you) to process your request and
              inform you of the consequences, including any legal consequences
              that may affect your rights and liabilities to us. Generally, we
              aim to process your request within ten (10) business days of
              receiving it. While we respect your decision to withdraw consent,
              please note that depending on the nature and scope of your
              request, we may not be able to continue providing our goods or
              services to you. In such cases, we will notify you before
              completing the processing of your request. If you decide to cancel
              your withdrawal of consent, please inform us in writing as
              described in clause 8 above. Please be aware that withdrawing
              consent does not affect our right to continue collecting, using,
              and disclosing personal data where such actions without consent
              are permitted or required under applicable laws.

              absolute security, we continually review and enhance our
              information security measures.
